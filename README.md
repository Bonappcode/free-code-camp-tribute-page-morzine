# free-code-camp-tribute-page-morzine
Just starting my journey into coding, this is part of The Odin Project and the Free Code Camp courses. Part way through the first project I thought it would be beneficial to get used to GitHub and VSCode. Any help, tips, criticisms, do's and don'ts greatly appreciated.  Thank you!
