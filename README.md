# free-code-camp-tribute-page-morzine
Just starting my journey into coding, this is part of The Odin Project and the Free Code Camp courses. Part way through the first project I thought it would be beneficial to get used to GitHub and VSCode. Any help, tips, criticisms, do's and don'ts greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

I think I'm going to come back to this page design once I have developed some more skills. I cannot get the page to look how I want to the main issue being the text over image I wanted for a title. I wanted a travellers scrapbook look.
