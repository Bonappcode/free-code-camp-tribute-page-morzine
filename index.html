  <h3>These awesome twin resort towns and their wonderful inhabitants have changed how I view my life and how I would like to live it. Morzine and its people have inspired me to make myself happier. It wasn't until I arrived in Morzine I realised how much more I was missing out on around the world. Having always dreamt there could be more outside of the grey Northern English mill town I grew up in. Believing it to be out of my reach these inspiring people, the daunting geography and the two very different but equally brilliant towns have shown me what can be done with a little hard work and determination. This is why my first project on the road to becoming a digital nomad (the dream) should I think definitely be a tribute to Morzine!</h3>

           <wrap class="polaroid-description">At this point the development of skiing in Morzine has to take a back seat. Used as smuggling route during World War Two into France by the French resistance and also as an escape out of France for Jewish people. This lead to Morzine eventually being occupied by the Nazis and then later the department of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute-Savoie target="_blank">Haute-Savoie</a> liberating itself.

<h4>Morzine has inspired me to become a digital nomad, to earn money whilst I am traveling, finding new amazing peope and places. Morzine seems worlds away from my hometown, a grim Northern England ex mill town.</h4>

<h4>Morzine has strived to keep its typical Savoyard character and culture, whilst also opening its doors to the tourist industry. The Savoyard strength, warmth and character is passed down from generation to generation. Morzine's true Savoyard culture has also preserved its agro-pastoral way of life, serving up typical tasty traditional Haute Savoyarde meals, mountain traditions and patois still spoken by real Morzinois.
